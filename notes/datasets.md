- CloudSEN12
  
CloudSEN12 is a LARGE dataset (~1 TB) for cloud semantic understanding comprising of 49,400 image patches (IP) that are evenly spread throughout all continents except Antarctica. Each IP has an average size of 5090 x 5090 meters and contains data from Sentinel-2 optical levels 1C and 2A, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), digital elevation model, surface water occurrence, land cover classes, and cloud mask results from eight cutting-edge cloud detection algorithms.

- CloudSEN12+
  
Detecting and screening clouds is the first step in any optical remote sensing (RS) analysis. Cloud formation is diverse, presenting many shapes, thicknesses, and altitudes. This variety poses a significant challenge to developing effective cloud detection algorithms since most datasets shortfall an unbiased representation. To address this issue, we have built CloudSEN12+, a significant expansion of the CloudSEN12 dataset. This new dataset doubles the expert-labeled pixels, making it the largest cloud detection dataset for Sentinel-2 imagery up to date. We have carefully reviewed and refined previous human labels in this new release to ensure maximum trustworthiness. We hope CloudSEN12+ will be a valuable resource for the cloud detection research community.

### KappaSet

**description:** 

The dataset consists of 9251 labelled sub-tiles from 1038 Sentinel-2 (S2) Level-1C (L1C) products distributed over the globe. In terms of seasonal distribution, S2 products can be divided into the following groups:

- Winter products: 29 austral and 142 boreal S2 products

- Spring products: 45 austral and 257 boreal S2 products

- Summer products: 30 austral and 293 boreal S2 products

- Autumn products:  29 austral and 213 boreal S2 products

### Sentinel-2 Cloud Mask Catalogue

https://zenodo.org/records/4172871#.YYI4BmBByUk

**description:** 

This dataset comprises cloud masks for 513 1022-by-1022 pixel subscenes, at 20m resolution, sampled random from the 2018 Level-1C Sentinel-2 archive. The design of this dataset follows from some observations about cloud masking: (i) performance over an entire product is highly correlated, thus subscenes provide more value per-pixel than full scenes, (ii) current cloud masking datasets often focus on specific regions, or hand-select the products used, which introduces a bias into the dataset that is not representative of the real-world data, (iii) cloud mask performance appears to be highly correlated to surface type and cloud structure, so testing should include analysis of failure modes in relation to these variables.


### S2-Hollstein

https://git.gfz-potsdam.de/EnMAP/sentinel2_manual_classification_clouds

**description:** 

Consists 5,647,725 pixels based on images acquired over the entire globe with cloud, cirrus, snow, shadow, and water labels.

### S2-BaetensHagolle

**link:** 
https://zenodo.org/records/1460961

**description:** 

This data set provides a reference cloud mask data set for 38 Sentinel-2 scenes. These reference masks have been created with the ALCD tool, developed by Louis Baetens, under the direction of Olivier Hagolle at CESBIO/CNES[1]. They were created to validate the cloud masks generated by the MAJA software [2].

# VENµS

### VENuS cloud mask training dataset

https://zenodo.org/records/7040177

**description:** 

Training dataset for cloud masking for VENμS satellite images. Samples are pixel-wise labelled scenes over the land of Israel, with a special focus on the southern, arid area.

### SEN2VENµS

https://zenodo.org/records/6514159

**description:** 

SEN2VENµS is an open dataset for the super-resolution of Sentinel-2 images by leveraging simultaneous acquisitions with the VENµS satellite. The dataset is composed of 10m and 20m cloud-free surface reflectance patches from Sentinel-2, with their reference spatially-registered surface reflectance patches at 5 meters resolution acquired on the same day by the VENµS satellite. This dataset covers 29 locations with a total of 132 955 patches of 256x256 pixels at 5 meters resolution, and can be used for the training of super-resolution algorithms to bring spatial resolution of 8 of the Sentinel-2 bands down to 5 meters.
