next i will just mention some of those from papers i read

# Sentinel-2

### CloudSEN12

https://github.com/cloudsen12/

**description:** 

CloudSEN12 is a LARGE dataset (~1 TB) for cloud semantic understanding comprising of 49,400 image patches (IP) that are evenly spread throughout all continents except Antarctica. Each IP has an average size of 5090 x 5090 meters and contains data from Sentinel-2 optical levels 1C and 2A, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), digital elevation model, surface water occurrence, land cover classes, and cloud mask results from eight cutting-edge cloud detection algorithms.

### KappaSet

**description:** 

The dataset consists of 9251 labelled sub-tiles from 1038 Sentinel-2 (S2) Level-1C (L1C) products distributed over the globe. In terms of seasonal distribution, S2 products can be divided into the following groups:

- Winter products: 29 austral and 142 boreal S2 products

- Spring products: 45 austral and 257 boreal S2 products

- Summer products: 30 austral and 293 boreal S2 products

- Autumn products:  29 austral and 213 boreal S2 products

### S2-Hollstein

**description:** 

Consists 5,647,725 pixels based on images acquired over the entire globe with cloud, cirrus, snow, shadow, and water labels.

### S2-BaetensHagolle

https://zenodo.org/records/1460961

**description:** 

This data set provides a reference cloud mask data set for 38 Sentinel-2 scenes. These reference masks have been created with the ALCD tool, developed by Louis Baetens, under the direction of Olivier Hagolle at CESBIO/CNES[1]. They were created to validate the cloud masks generated by the MAJA software [2].

# VENµS

### VENuS cloud mask training dataset

**link:** 
https://zenodo.org/records/7040177

**description:** 

Training dataset for cloud masking for VENμS satellite images. Samples are pixel-wise labelled scenes over the land of Israel, with a special focus on the southern, arid area.

### SEN2VENµS

**link:** 
https://zenodo.org/records/6514159

**description:** 

SEN2VENµS is an open dataset for the super-resolution of Sentinel-2 images by leveraging simultaneous acquisitions with the VENµS satellite. The dataset is composed of 10m and 20m cloud-free surface reflectance patches from Sentinel-2, with their reference spatially-registered surface reflectance patches at 5 meters resolution acquired on the same day by the VENµS satellite. This dataset covers 29 locations with a total of 132 955 patches of 256x256 pixels at 5 meters resolution, and can be used for the training of super-resolution algorithms to bring spatial resolution of 8 of the Sentinel-2 bands down to 5 meters.
