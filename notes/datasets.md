### SEN2VENµS

**popis:** 
SEN2VENµS is an open dataset for the super-resolution of Sentinel-2 images by leveraging simultaneous acquisitions with the VENµS satellite. The dataset is composed of 10m and 20m cloud-free surface reflectance patches from Sentinel-2, with their reference spatially-registered surface reflectance patches at 5 meters resolution acquired on the same day by the VENµS satellite. This dataset covers 29 locations with a total of 132 955 patches of 256x256 pixels at 5 meters resolution, and can be used for the training of super-resolution algorithms to bring spatial resolution of 8 of the Sentinel-2 bands down to 5 meters.
