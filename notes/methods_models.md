**description:** 

Sen2Cor is a processor for Sentinel-2 Level 2A product generation and formatting; it performs the atmospheric-, terrain- and cirrus correction of Top-Of-Atmosphere Level 1C input data. Sen2Cor creates Bottom-Of-Atmosphere, optionally terrain- and cirrus corrected reflectance images; and additionally, Aerosol Optical Thickness-, Water Vapor-, Scene Classification Map and Quality Indicators for cloud and snow probabilities. Its output product format is equivalent to the Level 1C User Product: JPEG 2000 images, with three different resolutions, 60, 20 and 10 m.

### s2cloudless

**description:** 

The s2cloudless Python package provides automated cloud detection in Sentinel-2 imagery. The classification is based on a single-scene pixel-based cloud detector developed by Sentinel Hub's research team and is described in more detail in this blog.

### s2cloudmask

https://github.com/daleroberts/s2cloudmask

**description:** 

The s2cloudmask Python package provides machine learning classifiers for Cloud and Shadow Detection in Sentinel-2 observations. The aim of this package is to open-source and showcase some of the tools being developed as part of the Digital Earth Australia initiative, and further, to push the state-of-art in the area of cloud classification.
